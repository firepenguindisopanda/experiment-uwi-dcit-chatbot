## NEXT STEPS

###Split the Code into Backend (API) and Frontend (Dashboard):

- Use Flask or FastAPI to create a backend API that exposes endpoints for interacting with the chatbot and managing data.

- Create a React frontend for the data scientist's dashboard and another one for normal users.

### Backend (API) - Choose a Framework:

-Decide whether you want to use Flask or FastAPI. Both are excellent choices, but FastAPI is known for its speed and automatic API documentation.

### Create API Endpoints:

- Define API endpoints for actions like querying the chatbot, updating the knowledge base, and retrieving recent events.

- Implement these endpoints using the existing logic in your Streamlit app.

### ORM for Data Storage:

- Consider using an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to store and retrieve data. SQLAlchemy is a popular choice for Python.

### Database Setup:

- Set up a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) to store data like user questions, chatbot responses, and additional information.

### Authentication and Authorization:

- Implement user authentication for data scientists and other admin users who can manage the knowledge base.

- Implement user roles and permissions to control access to different parts of the system.

### Frontend (React):

- Create a React app for the data scientist's dashboard and another for normal users.
- Use a state management library like Redux or React Context for managing the application state.

### API Integration in React:

- Use the fetch API or a library like Axios to make requests to your backend API from the React frontend.

### User Interface (UI):

- Design a user-friendly interface for both the data scientist's dashboard and the user interaction page.
- Implement forms for adding new data to the knowledge base.

### Real-time Updates:

- If needed, implement real-time updates using WebSockets or other technologies.

### Deployment:

- Deploy the backend (Flask/FastAPI) to a server (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or your preferred cloud provider).

- Deploy the React frontend to a static file host (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) or the same server as the backend.

### Documentation:

- Document your API endpoints, data models, and any other important information.

### Testing:

- Write tests for both the backend and frontend to ensure reliability.

### Scaling:

= Optimize and scale your application as needed, depending on the number of users and data.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

- Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.

### Security:

- Implement security best practices to protect your application from common vulnerabilities.

### Monitoring:

- Set up monitoring tools to track the performance and health of your application.
